A page to keep track of what I'm reading or have read:

Currently Reading:

- The Almanack of Naval Ravikant
- 

Read once:

- I think I'm only gonna update this with books I start reading now & the future from here. Also, I don't think reading a good book once is enough so I will need to come up with a way to not feel good after reading once, what I'm thinking right now is to look at this list to be encouraged to re-read.
