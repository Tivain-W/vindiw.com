### startup

been seeing an honestly surprising number of totally organic sign ups for [VoiceoverGPT](https://www.voiceovergpt.app/) and I noticed a place where I can easily improve the conversion rate.

![VoiceoverGPT user journey](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3b8a489d-472d-4e4f-900f-16a5269b89e0.heic)

the drop from upload to voiceover generation, my hypothesis by looking at analytics events is that not everyone has an OpenAI API key and/or feels ok using it on the app despite it being stored in local storage and all the requests to OpenAI’s API being made from the client-side (can be monitored from network tab on browser dev tools). so to fix this I’m going to do a re-launch Wednesday next week (4 weeks since my [initial viral launch](https://twitter.com/vindiww/status/1724519150524260517)) with a couple of trial credits that charge my OpenAI account so that users can test it. for the users who uploaded the video but weren’t able to generate a voiceover, I’m going to generate them & email them.

the website visitor to sign up conversion rate can also be probably increased by allowing a non-sign up interactive live demo, I really love the one from [Replicate’s home page](https://replicate.com)

submitted my 46th startup school weekly update, I used to feel anxious through the week about forgetting to submit this and losing my streak, but after starting to write these weekly update I don’t feel so often because I’m pretty sure I wrote this :)
