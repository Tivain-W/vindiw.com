2023 was the best year of my life although it was full of rollercoasters. I learnt a lot of important lessons that are surely gonna make 2024 a lot better!

### startup

I have to be honest, very little work got done between christmas & now :) but honestly it was some much needed family time and fun and I don’t regret the quality time I got to spend with the people that matter the most to me, I’m more recharged and ready than ever now to crush through work in 2024!

submitted my 49th startup school weekly update :)
