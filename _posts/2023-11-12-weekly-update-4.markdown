### startup

we had a call with a potential user who was interested in using our tool as an API, so we’re going to give that a go starting with a demo version of the API to test from the week starting tomorrow.

Backdrop Build kicked off of Monday and it was exciting to see the amount of fellow builders + the energy brought in by the founders of Backdrop, Joey & Rapha

OpenAI’s Dev Day was shortly after the kickoff of Backdrop ended and boy was it exciting, it was really cool to see the new stuff they released!

It was great to test the new DALL-E 3, TTS, Assistants & GPT-4 Vision APIs with some streamlit apps ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/vindiw/openai-devday-2023)).
