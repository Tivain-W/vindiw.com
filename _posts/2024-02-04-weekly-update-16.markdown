### startup

i’m starting to feel really happy and bullish about this new attempt at DASH-E, definitely has a lot to do with having GPT-4 this time around + having acquired more skills & learnings from previous mistakes. the goal is to have the initial version in the hands of 10-15 users this coming week and getting early feedback to iron out any obvious kinks shortly before doing a launch on twitter.

54 weeks of startup school updates now! (i’m going to stop posting this on here since it doesn’t add anything meaningful to my log)

### stuff I read (and/or watched) this week

finally finished reading The Almanack of Naval Ravikant, it was a really good book with a ton of great and actionable advice, thoroughly enjoyed reading it!

currently reading The Anthology of Balaji which is also amazing!

I managed to stick to a habit of reading at least ~1hr everyday.

i started keeping track of the links of essays/blogs/articles I read + interesting videos I watched on a google sheet hoping to be able to paste them here, but it feels excessive seeing all those links, need to look at building a simple agent that handles this for me after the DASH-E rewrite:

### the end

the interesting update I expected to have this week is still in progress, but high chance that’d be there by next week. i’m trying not to rush out DASH-E looking too half baked. thank you for reading my weekly update!
