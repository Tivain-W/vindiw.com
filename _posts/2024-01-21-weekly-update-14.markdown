### startup

not really having anything notable to say for this week, but next sunday might have some exciting news :)

it’s been 1 whole year since I started submitting weekly updates to startup school, what a streak!

### stuff I read (and/or watched) this week

Go West, Young Man by Flo Crivello - [https://flocrivello.com/go-west-young-man](https://flocrivello.com/go-west-young-man)

I’ve been having this open in a tab for a few weeks now, finally got around to watching it and Lee’s teaching skills are top notch - [https://youtu.be/h2BcitZPMn4](https://youtu.be/h2BcitZPMn4)

this was great just like any other veritasium video! - [https://youtu.be/fG8SwAFQFuU](https://youtu.be/fG8SwAFQFuU)

this speech by Milei (Argentina’s new president) was great, highly recommend listening to it - [https://twitter.com/aphysicist/status/1747868626948907325](https://twitter.com/aphysicist/status/1747868626948907325)
