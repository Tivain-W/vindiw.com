it’s a new year & it’s time to put in the effort to make myself proud by the end of this year!

I love the look of the number 2024!

### startup

I received some really valuable feedback for VoiceoverGPT which was a great way to get started with shipping for 2024! made a few good discoveries while doing that and I’m excited about the prospects 2024 has in store :)

just submitted my 50th startup school weekly update!
